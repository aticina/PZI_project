                            Pablo Picasso is probably the most important figure of the 20th century, in terms of art,
                            and art movements that occurred over this period. Before the age of 50, the Spanish born
                            artist had become the most well-known name in modern art, with the most distinct style 
                            and eye for artistic creation. There had been no other artists, prior to Picasso, who had
                            such an impact on the art world, or had a mass following of fans and critics alike, as he did.
                            Take a moment to get lost in the grand lie that is art,which reveals truth,at this exhibition!

                            Slava Raškaj was a Croatian painter, considered to be the greatest Croatian watercolorist of the late 
                            19th and early 20th century. Deaf since birth, Raškaj was schooled in Vienna and Zagreb, where her mentor 
                            was the renowned Croatian painter Bela Čikoš Sesija. In the 1890s her works were exhibited around Europe, 
                            including at the 1900 Expo in Paris. In her twenties Raškaj was diagnosed with acute depression and was 
                            institutionalised for the last three years of her life before dying in 1906 from tuberculosis in Zagreb. 
                            The value of her work was largely overlooked by art historians in the following decades, but in the late 
                            1990s and early 2000s interest in her work was revived. We are calling all watercolor appreciators to visit
                            us this month.

                            Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential 
                            figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, 
                            including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His oeuvre includes 
                            landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterised by bold colours and 
                            dramatic brushwork that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art. Everyone is welcome to lose
                            themselves in magical art of a man that saw and felt the world differently than most.
